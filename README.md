# Download Music
_Download Music_ is a free and fast song and music album downloading platform with no ADs and logins. The platform currently has 2.2 million songs and I am working to bring 9 million more to the platform. Love to help out?

## Repo Information
- This project is built using `crate react app`, so it is a react based application
- `emotion` is used as the CSS framework and as you would notice all the icons are inlined SVGs
- `apollo client` is used for making API calls to the backend ([link to backend repo](https://github.com/Confidence-Okoghenun/download-music-api))
- This project is currently hosted on `vercel`. Here is the link [downloadmusic.now.sh](https://downloadmusic.now.sh)

## Build And Deploy
As mentioned earlier this project is built using `create react app` and comes with the standard build commands
```
$ yarn start #starts off local dev server
$ yarn build #optimizes the project for deploy and outputs to /build
```

Connect the project to your hosting provider (i.e netlify or vercel) and they will handle the deploy process for you

## Project Road Map
This is the roadmap of the project for the foreseeable future:
- [x] Release first stable version
- [ ] Implement testing
- [ ] Add more songs to platform
- [ ] Optimize for speed
